          <h4><i><strong>(3) Privacy policy</strong></i></h4>
          <h4><i>What are the purposes we use your data for?</i></h4>
          <p><i>A portion of the information is generated to guarantee the error free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user patterns.</i></p>
          <h4><i>Analysis tools and tools provided by third parties</i></h4>
          <p><i>There is a possibility that your browsing patterns will be statistically analysed when your visit our website. Such analyses are performed primarily with cookies and with what we refer to as analysis programmes. As a rule, the analyses of your browsing patterns are conducted anonymously; i.e. the browsing patterns cannot be traced back to you.</i></p>
          <h4><i>MailChimp</i></h4>
          <p><i>This website uses the services of MailChimp to send out its newsletters. The provider is the Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.<br>Among other things, MailChimp is a service that can be deployed to organise and analyse the sending of newsletters. Whenever you enter data for the purpose of subscribing to a newsletter (e.g. your e-mail address), the information is stored on MailChimp servers in the United States.<br>MailChimp is in possession of a certification that is in compliance with the „EU-US-Privacy-Shield.“ The „Privacy-Shield“ is a compact between the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (USA) that aims to warrant the compliance with European data protection standards in the United States.<br>With the assistance of the MailChimp tool, we can analyse the performance of our newsletter campaigns. If you open an e-mail that has been sent through the MailChimp tool, a file that has been integrated into the e-mail (a so-called web-beacon) connects to MailChimp’s servers in the United States. As a result, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links the recipient possibly clicked on. Technical information is also recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access, the IP address, type of browser and operating system). This information cannot be allocated to the respective newsletter recipient. Their sole purpose is the performance of statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The results of such analyses can be used to tailor future newsletters to the interests of their recipients more effectively.<br>If you do not want to permit an analysis by MailChimp, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a link for you to do this in every newsletter message.<br>The data is processed based on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke any consent you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation.<br>The data you archive with us for the purpose of the newsletter subscription shall be archived by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Once you cancel your subscription to the newsletter, the data shall be deleted from our servers as well as those of MailChimp. This shall not affect data we have been archiving for other purposes.</i></p>
          <h4><i>Google Analytics</i></h4>
          <p><i>This website uses <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). That service uses cookies to help us understand how users browse Baffi. The information generated by Google Analytics about your use of the website will be anonymised, then transmitted to and stored by Google. On behalf of the website provider, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</i></p>

If your browser should not support Web Fonts, a standard font installed on your computer will be used.
